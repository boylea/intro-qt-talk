These are the source files for my Intro to Qt + Python talk. This presentation was created using [Hovercraft!](https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft), which is based on [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js).

To build the presentation, first install hovercraft, then run:

`hovercraft qttalk.rst build`

The presentation can then be found at build/index.html
